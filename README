Just a simple bash script for now.. Just a simple bash script for now.. 

$ ./remote 

USAGE: ./remote <user> <server> [disable|delete|enable]

without optional 3rd argmuent, will create specified user's account on
the server and add set up their ssh pub key for them if we have it.

Currently looking for ssh public keys in: ~/keys
edit ./remote to change this location

optional 3rd argument:
    disable = locks their password and moves their ssh credentials
    enable  = resets their password and moves their ssh credentials back
    delete  = completely removes their account
